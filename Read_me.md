# Introduction
All the software development projects will be saved in here and I am thrilled to start on my journey as becomming a developer.
These are more so going to be refactory projects and all the skills acquired are going to be added in this repo
The commitment to this journey is quite interesting as I am caching up with two courses at the same time ( while finalizing with my degree, I am in the refactory catalyst program which almost requires half of my time)
